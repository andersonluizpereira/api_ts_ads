#API_TS_ADS

Well the application is about Frankstein, rs, where she registers sports news and newspapers.

The application is a backend with nodejs + typescript, I tried to bring the best of both worlds.

When downloading the application it uses mongodb as a database and redis for the biggest queries.

When downloading the application, type `npm install`.

If you want to start the database, start with npm run docker_start and if you want to npm run docker_stop.

First of all compile the npm run compile application. And see if you created the dist folder, and check if you created the config folder, if you haven't created it, copy those folders with those contents into the dist folder.

And to start the application type npm run start.

For production application, I am creating the image.

I left a Postman collection for anyone who wants to play, start by creating a user.

I tried to make a compilation where I tried to join the course
